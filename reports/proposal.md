Your project proposal should answer the following questions:

1) What is the goal of your project; for example, what do you plan to make, and what should it do?  Identify a lower bound you are confident you can achieve and a stretch goal that is more ambitious.

2) What are your learning goals; that is, what do you intend to achieve by working on this project?

3) What do you need to get started?  Have you found the resources you need, do you have a plan to find them, or do you need help?

4) What are your first steps?  Describe at least three concrete tasks that you can do immediately, and identify which member of the team will do them.  For each one, what is the "definition of done"; that is, what will you produce to demonstrate that the task is done?





1) Choose a short, pronounceable, professional name for your team.  If you want, you can use the adjective-animal schema, like AppallingAardvarks.

2) Within the olincollege GitHub organization, create a repository called SoftSysYourTeamName and invite the instructor (syclops (Links to an external site.)) and the CAs (jack-greenberg and naviatolin) as collaborators.

3) Within that repo, create a folder called reports. Within that folder, create a Markdown document called proposal.md.

4) At the top of this document, give your project a meaningful name that at least suggests the topic of the project.  Don't call it "Software Systems Project 1".  List the complete names of all members of the team. 

5) Answer the questions in the Content section, above. Use typesetting features to indicate the organization of the document.  Do not include the questions as part of your document.

6) Complete your proposal, view it on GitHub, and copy the GitHub URL.  Then paste the URL in the submission space below.  You only need one proposal for each team, but everyone should submit it.

7) On Trello, you should soon receeive an invitation to join a team. Please accept this invitation. If you do not receive the invite by the deadline, let me know.  Once you are on the Trello team, create a new board with the name of your project team.  Create three columns, named TODO, DOING, AND DONE, and populate the TODO column with the tasks you identified.
